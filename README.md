This is on github because it's easiest. If you want to try the program, just download the file and upload into Google Colab.

Also I think the output still has pictures of my face in it lol.
Feel free to let me know how well the code works for you, in my experience moving the camera or rapidly moving your face drastically decreases it's efficiency, but that's to be expected.
